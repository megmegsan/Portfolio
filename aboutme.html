            <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Hey there, my name is Megan Zhang :). I was born in Northern California and am currently a senior at Castro Valley High School. I love math and art and am currently looking at engineering, computer science, or advertising as a possible major in college (I know, I'm super indecisive). Anyway, if you are curious enough to look through my webpage, you'll probably find out a lot about me... or not. Either way enjoy your time here :).</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I'll try my best not to state the obvious... I would write something like "I love dogs!" but who doesn't?? If you do doge a large dislike, then you should heckin leave now.ヾ(`ヘ´)ﾉﾞ</p>
               <img src="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/674/934/422.jpg" alt="Screaming Doge" style="width: 320px; height: 240px; margin-left: 80px; border: 3px">

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Now that that's been established, what I really like are horror films, especially Korean or Japanese ones. Recently I watched <i>Train to Busan (2016)</i> and it was really awesome (and not just because Gong Yoo is in it)! I usually don't watch zombie movies, but this one was directed well and I seriously couldn't guess what would happen next... Well here are some pics:</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">As for books, I actually don't know many horror stories. I'm not particular about specific genres, but my favorite series (for a looong time now) is <i>The Mysterious Benedict Society</i> series. If you read it, you won't regret it. (*´▽`*)</p>
         <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family: georgia; margin-left: 30px">Dislikes</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I guess one thing I dislike is when people aren't being straightforward when the situation calls for it. It's probably because I'm straightforward myself. ┐( ˘ ､ ˘ )┌</p>
         <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family: georgia; margin-left: 30px">'Fun Facts'</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Well, I do daydream a lot. I guess something <i>weird</i> about me is sometimes I have a superhero complex??</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Yeah, so I'll start daydreaming about really bad situations that could occur when I'm at school or if I was walking around outside. Then I think about how I'll react or how I'll get out of it. There are no superpowers involved though, just parkour and freerunning.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">And another: I'm learning German and will be in AP German at school this fall. I just find it funny that everyone is surprised about this when I tell them. I wanted to learn German for a semi-random reason: before choosing a foreign language class to take in high school, I watched <i>Hetalia Axis Powers</i>, an anime about the World Wars haha. I liked the character who played Germany lmao, that's the only reason. It was a win-win (NCT reference :3) because it was a fun class in the end.</p>
         <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family: georgia; margin-left: 30px">Projects</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Here is the title page of a side-scroller game Samiksha and I made:</p>
               <img src="https://megmegsan.github.io/Portfolio/SavingGeorge.PNG" alt="Saving George Side-Scroller Title Page" width="500" height:"300" style="margin-left: 30px; border: 3px">
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">And here is a picture of my group's robot during our robotics unit...</p>
               <img src="https://megmegsan.github.io/Portfolio/IMG_4098.JPG" alt="LED on Robot" width="408" height="306" style="margin-left: 30px; border: 3px">
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Well, the most complex circuit we could make that actually worked was when we connected three jumper wires with two LEDs and a resistor to a button. When we turned on the circuit and pressed the button, both the LEDs turned on, but they were very dim. Basically we connected one jumper wire to Ground and lined it up with the button. The other end of the button connected with the another jumper wire which connected with the two LEDs and resistor. Then the last jumper wire connected with the resistor to the voltage.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">After today, my idea of robots has become more complex and broad. It's good to know that, in the future, we can use artificial intelligence to help many people, whether for warfare, medical reasons, or convenience. However, if more of what we rely on becomes even more technological-based in the future, there's the issue of accessibility; anyone could end up using a robot for their own immoral reason rather than the intended reason for which the robot was made.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Overall, being able to work with a group on our robot made the process a lot easier. We were able to figure out things faster (turning on the LEDs) and start experimenting with other parts of the robot. Next time it would be better if we could make our light brighter or even change color.</p>
         <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family: georgia; margin-left: 30px">Videos and Links</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">This video is what turned me into a MyDay, aka a fan of Day6, a K-ROCK band. (ღ˘⌣˘ღ)</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">The best part is, the guy who's acting as the 'boyfriend' in this video is the same guy who played the baseball player in <i>Train to Busan</i>. ( : ౦ ‸ ౦ : )</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">"Lean On Me" is also cool because it sounds like an anime opening :'3</p>
               <iframe width="560" height="315" style="margin-left: 150px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9BsPywWQIU" frameborder="3" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I didn't say this before but I've been into K-POP ever since SHINee's "Ring Ding Dong" lmao. But I don't listen to SHINee anymore oops. But I started listening to Urban Zakapa thanks to my sis. I really like their music because it's mellower and the lyrics are <i>real nice.</i></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Aside from K-POP, I like reading webtoons and manga and watching anime! I have a short list of recommendations for each (click on one if you want to read or watch it!)...</p>
