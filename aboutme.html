I was born in Northern California and am currently a senior at Castro Valley High School (sen18rity!). I love math and art and am currently looking at engineering, computer science, or advertising as a possible major in college (I know, I'm super indecisive). Anyway, if you are curious enough to look through my webpage, you'll probably find out a lot about me... or not. Either way enjoy your time here :).</p>
