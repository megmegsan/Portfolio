I was born in Northern California and am currently a senior at Castro Valley High School (sen18rity!). I love math and art and am currently looking at engineering, computer science, or advertising as a possible major in college (I know, I'm super indecisive). Anyway, if you are curious enough to look through my webpage, you'll probably find out a lot about me... or not. Either way enjoy your time here :).</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">Now that that's been established, what I really like are horror films, especially Korean or Japanese ones. Recently I watched <i>Train to Busan (2016)</i> and it was really awesome (and not just because Gong Yoo was in it xD)! I usually don't watch zombie movies, but this one was directed well and I seriously couldn't guess what would happen next... Well here are some pics:</p>
