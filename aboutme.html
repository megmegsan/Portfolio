      <p style="text-align: center; font-family: garamond; color: white; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Hey there, my name is Megan Zhang :). I was born in Northern California and am currently a senior at Castro Valley High School (sen18rity!). I love math and art and am currently looking at engineering, computer science, or advertising as a possible major in college (I know, I'm super indecisive). Anyway, if you are curious enough to look through my webpage, you'll probably find out a lot about me... or not. Either way enjoy your time here :).</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I'll try my best not to state the obvious... I would write something like "I love dogs!" but who doesn't?? If you do doge a large dislike, then you should heckin leave now.ヾ(`ヘ´)ﾉﾞ</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">Okay, actually, since I'm talking about animals anyway, my favorite animal is a red panda.</p>
         <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 80px">I mean</p>
         <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 110px">feast your eyes (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">Now that that's been established, what I really like are horror films, especially Korean or Japanese ones. Recently I watched <i>Train to Busan (2016)</i> and it was really awesome (and not just because Gong Yoo is in it)! I usually don't watch zombie movies, but this one was directed well and I seriously couldn't guess what would happen next... Well here are some pics:</p>

      <img src="http://3ipycv2ugat81cqgps20hwke.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TRAIN-TO-BUSAN_STILL-CUT-5.jpg" alt="Ma Dong-Seok in <i>Train to Busan</i>" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; margin-left: 30px" border="2"><br><p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 220px">I know, <em>very dramatic.</em>
      <p style="color: white; font-family; garamond; margin-left: 30px">As for books, I actually don't know many horror stories. I'm not particular about specific genres, but my favorite series (for a looong time now) is <i>The Mysterious Benedict Society</i> series. If you read it, you won't regret it. (*´▽`*)</p>
      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">Dislikes</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I guess one thing I dislike is when people aren't being straightforward when the situation calls for it. And yes, there is a big difference between being a straightforward person and being a straight-up jerk... So there's that. The reason why I probably dislike when people don't get to the point is because I'm straightforward myself. ┐( ˘ ､ ˘ )┌</p>
      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">'Fun Facts'</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Well, I do daydream a lot. I guess something <i>weird</i> about me is sometimes I have a superhero complex??</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Yeah, so I'll start daydreaming about really bad situations that could occur when I'm at school or if I was walking around outside. Then I think about how I'll react or how I'll get out of it. There are no superpowers involved though, just parkour and freerunning.</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">And another: I'm learning German and will be in AP German at school this fall. I just find it funny that everyone is surprised about this when I tell them. I wanted to learn German for a semi-random reason: before choosing a foreign language class to take in high school, I watched <i>Hetalia Axis Powers</i>, an anime about the World Wars haha. I liked the character who played Germany lmao, that's the only reason. Regardless, I ended up loving the class, my teacher, and the language, so it was a win-win in the end (did anyone catch the NCT reference?).</p>
      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">Projects</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">So I recently started learning code with Girls Who Code. Two of my classmates and I created a side-scrolling game called "Saving George." It's so glitchy lmao, but here's a screenshot of the title page:</p>
      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">Videos and Links</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">The best part about this page.</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">OKAY GUYS. This video is what turned me into a MyDay, aka a fan of Day6, a K-ROCK band. (ღ˘⌣˘ღ)</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px"><i>The crazy part is</i>, the guy who's acting as the 'boyfriend' in this video is the same guy who played the baseball player in <i>Train to Busan</i>. ( : ౦ ‸ ౦ : )</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">"Lean On Me" is also cool because it sounds like an anime opening :'3</p>
