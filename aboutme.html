      <p style="text-align: center; font-family: garamond; color: white; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Hey there, my name is Megan Zhang :). I was born in Northern California and am currently a senior at Castro Valley High School (sen18rity!). I love math and art and am currently looking at engineering, computer science, or advertising as a possible major in college (I know, I'm super indecisive). Anyway, if you are curious enough to look through my webpage, you'll probably find out a lot about me... or not. Either way enjoy your time here :).</p>

      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">Likes</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I'll try my best not to state the obvious... I would write something like "I love dogs!" but who doesn't?? If you do doge a dislike, then you just done me a big sad and should heckin leave now.</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">Okay, actually, since I'm talking about animals anyway, my favorite animal is a red panda.<br style="margin-left: 80px">I mean<br style=margin-left: 130px">feast your eyes.</p>

      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">Now that that's been established, what I really like are horror films, especially Korean or Japanese ones. Recently I watched <i>Train to Busan (2016)</i> and it was really awesome (and not just because Gong Yoo was in it)! I usually don't watch zombie movies, but this one was directed well and I seriously couldn't guess what would happen next... Well here are some pics:</p>

      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">Dislikes</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">I guess one thing I dislike is when people aren't being straightforward when the situation calls for it. And yes, there is a big difference between being a straightforward person and being a straight-up jerk... So there's that. The reason why I probably dislike when people don't get to the point is because I'm straightforward myself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
      <h4 style="color: mediumpurple; font-family georgia; margin-left: 30px">'Fun Facts'</h4>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Honestly, 'fun' is a broad term. My mind is currently blanking out... Well, I do daydream a lot. I guess something <i>weird</i> about me is sometimes I have a superhero complex??</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">Yeah, so I'll start daydreaming about really bad situations that could occur when I'm at school or if I was walking around outside. Then I think about how I might get injured during these situations or how I'll react or how I get out of it. There are no superpowers involved though, just parkour and freerunning.</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">And another, because why not? 
      <p style="color: white; font-family: garamond; margin-left: 30px">I love reading <a href="http://www3.mangafreak.net/Manga/Shingeki_No_Kyojin" target="_blank">Shingeki no Kyojin</a>!</p>
