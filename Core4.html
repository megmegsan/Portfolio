        <p>The blocks in Scratch are similar to the commands that I have to type out using Python. In Scratch, however, I can easily change the pen color, while for Python I have to pay attention to small details, such as using quotations. Scratch and Python are also different in terms of loops. How I set up the command in Scratch uses the "repeat" block while Python uses "for, in."</p>
        <p>The hard part is knowing what to write to even get the code started. Once I had that down, it was easier to start drawing other shapes and adding color, or implement loops and conditionals. Once I figured out how to fix the problem in my code to get it running, I gained more confidence and felt more optimistic about solving future problems.</p>
    <p>Here is the title page of a side-scroller game Samiksha and I made:</p>

            <p>And here is a picture of my group's robot during our robotics unit...</p>

            <p>Well, the most complex circuit we could make that actually worked was when we connected three jumper wires with two LEDs and a resistor to a button. When we turned on the circuit and pressed the button, both the LEDs turned on, but they were very dim. Basically we connected one jumper wire to Ground and lined it up with the button. The other end of the button connected with the another jumper wire which connected with the two LEDs and resistor. Then the last jumper wire connected with the resistor to the voltage.</p>
            <p>After today, my idea of robots has become more complex and broad. It's good to know that, in the future, we can use artificial intelligence to help many people, whether for warfare, medical reasons, or convenience. However, if more of what we rely on becomes even more technological-based in the future, there's the issue of accessibility; anyone could end up using a robot for their own immoral reason rather than the intended reason for which the robot was made.</p>
            <p>Overall, being able to work with a group on our robot made the process a lot easier. We were able to figure out things faster (turning on the LEDs) and start experimenting with other parts of the robot. Next time it would be better if we could make our light brighter or even change color.</p>
    <p><b>July 12</b><br>Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with artificial intelligence. They both try to improve robots by giving them intelligence and reactions similar to humans.</p>
    <p>My team and I did not understand how to write the code out at first. We learned the command "digitalWrite" and how to use the for-loop later on though. The easy part for us was connecting the actual circuits on the breadboard, but we it took some time to figure out what was lacking in our code... We later found that we only wrote "index + 1" in our for-loop instead of "index = index + 1". Our teamwork could have improved if we were less split up on the work. Two of us were specifically working on the code while the other two specifically worked on the circuits. A combined effort may have made the process smoother.</p>
    <p>The basic pieces for every Arduino sketch is to first define each light and give it a pin value. Then we just input the void setup() and the void loop().</p> 
    <p><b>July 13</b><br>I learned that circuits can do a wide range of things... Such as making a robot move, sing, and light up. I wonder what else it can make a robot do? My favorite part about my robot's dance was that it didn't move at all. Hopefully next time we can make the robot move forwards, backwards, and turn.</p>
    <p>I believe Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need their robots to program what they learn into themselves to remember it next time.</p>

    <p>Today, through trial and error, I learned how to make a robot back up and turn a certain direction if it bumps into another object. I also learned how careful I had to be when putting a block of code in a specific place. In order for me to keep the robot moving forward when it doesn't touch anything, I had to put the movement in an "else" statement outside of the rest of the code instead of using an "if" statement. Lastly, I learned from Latisha about how to simplify the code by using functions, such as "backward()", "forward()", "left()", and "right()", and defining them all in separate blocks.</p>

    <p>In Python, we use lists by adding elements within brackets. I think lists can be very useful because you can organize items into a list by specific characteristics, and if you wanted to add a list into your code, instead of writing everything down, you just insert your list name. It's especially useful adding on from one list to another using append or extend.</p>
    <p>I believe that the first day we worked on Obamicon I liked my group better. I think it's because everyone was asking each other questions on how to start the code, but by the second day, most people were already done and worked on their own extensions. But overall, having partners for projects is always a good thing.</p>
    <p>I learned how big a role JavaScript plays in the aesthetic webpages we often see. I also was able to see just how far I have to go before I reach that level of awesome ;-;.</p>
    <p>Based on what I know about LaTeX... It seems to be a markup language because it specifically changes the format of a document, so it doesn't seem very interactive like JavaScript.</p>
    <p><b>July 19</b></p>
    <p>After reading the Django tutorial about how the code in Atom translates to the blog site, I was able to understand how some parts of the model works.</p>
    <p>Right now, reading about querysets for Django and the Deploy! section confused me. And it's getting harder for the website to work as I get further into the tutorial. For example, I forgot one comma in the code and I went through the tutorial again just to fix it, or else the whole website wouldn't work.</p>
    <p><b>July 24</b></p>
    <p>I guess there's a lot of information about me on the internet because I have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Tumblr. On top of that, my medical records are in hospitals...</p>
    <p>A programmer can make a website secure by having the "secure 'S'" in their URL. But in general, with the internet being available to everyday people, there's always going to be a concern about security online.</p>
    <p>Latanya Sweeney uses technology to solve societal, political, and governance problems and she directs the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard University. Shafi Goldwasser co-invented the "zero-knowledge proofs."</p>
    <p>This summer I believe my favorite project was the Text Adventure project. I thought that being able to extend the project would be really cool. For example, the text adventure could be extended to a game app with added graphics (similar to what we did for the side-scroller game) and make it similar to a simple RPG. Or it could be a thought-provoking text adventure about life choices and the consequences (something that teaches younger kids about what they have to inevitably face, i.e. college, peer pressure, etc. in a fun way).</p>
    <p>To be able to implement this though, it would be nice to know how to build game apps for phones or upload personal drawings onto the game instead of using graphics from Google Images.</p>
    <p><b>July 26</b></p>
    <p>Python dictionaries are useful for storing different information under a key that you can later refer back to. I like data science to an extent but I've enjoyed coding in Python more. The most interesting thing about algorithms are the different approaches/methods to sorting a list. Being able to discover new ways sorting helps computer science a lot in terms of efficiency.</p>
    <p><b>July 27</b></p>
    <p>Using objects when writing code makes the code easier to read, and it becomes easier when you make multiple objects for one class. The hard part was knowing where to integrate the object into the code. One thing I'm proud of is figuring out how to store the usernames into a list and being able to show the list in the code after inputting a username. I also figured out how to use a while loop for once...</p>
    <p><b>July 28</b></p>
    <p>I am proud of figuring out how to loop the social network back to beginning (using a "while" loop and the "continue" command). I also was able to add connections between two users but I still haven't figured out how to store the data into the list yet. For final projects, I'm most excited about seeing how the graphics will turn out for the role-playing game and which genre my group and I will decide on for the storyline...</p>
    <p><b>August 1</b></p>
    <p>For our visual novel, we are all working on the storyline and coding it out. I'm going to be working on the background and character graphics while Venus and Joyce mostly work on the setting functions, the tutorial, and homepage. For our roles, I'm the leader of the group, Joyce is the note-taker, and Venus is the time-keeper.</p>
    <p>Venus makes sure we are working on the tasks that are due that day, which is kept on the Kanban board. I lead brainstorming and discussions about the storyline and how we might want the game functions to be laid out. During these discussions, Joyce takes notes on key information that we will later use in our game.</p>
    <p><b>August 2</b></p>
    <p>The greatest challenge we faced today was solving a specific syntax error involving the "menu" command on Ren'Py. In the end all we had to do was indent one more time... We also had to change the "label" tag names because they all have to be different for the story to run. Well, we soon figured that Google is our best friend, so we should always copy and paste the error into Google first to see how to solve our problem.</p>
