        <td><b>Variables</b></td>
          <td>Stores a value that can be changed; gives a specific output</td>
          <td>Variables are used in math as letters. Maybe someone asks a question (variable) that yields a specific answer (output).</td>
          <td>You use the equal sign to assign a value to a variable, which can be anything you want. For example, "answer = 5".</td>
          <td>You create your own variable and blocks show up where you can set your variable to a value or change the value.</td>

          <td>When you put your playlist on loop, it automatically goes down the list and plays the next song.</td>
          <td>You can use "for, in" to create a loop. For example, "for [variable] in range(3):" the variable would repeat 3 times.</td>
          <td>You can use repeat() blocks, repeat until() blocks, or forever loop blocks.</td>

          <td>When scientists form hypotheses, they use "if, then" statements. Basically, "if" they perform a specific task on a variable, "then" the variable will change in a specific way.</td>
          <td>In your code, you would type "if [variable] == 'str':" and indent in the next line to write whatever code is nested in the conditional.</td>
          <td>There are "if, then" loops as well as "if, then, else" loops.</td>

        <tr>
          <td><b>Functions</b></td>
          <td>Contains chunks of code (simplified), is reuseable, and does a specific task</td>
          <td>In math they're expressions that can be graphed.</td>
          <td>They're similar to commands. If you want text to show up in your text editor, you use the function "print()".</td>
          <td>When you make a "define" block, you'll create a variable. When the variable is used in your code, the code will run whatever is under the "define" block.</td>
