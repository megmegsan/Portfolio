        <p style="color: white; family-font: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px>The blocks in Scratch are similar to the commands that I have to type out using Python. In Scratch, however, I can easily change the pen color, while for Python I have to pay attention to small details, such as using quotations. Scratch and Python are also different in terms of loops. How I set up the command in Scratch uses the "repeat" block while Python uses "for, in."</p>
        <p style="color: white; family-font: garamond; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px>The hard part is knowing what to write to even get the code started. Once I had that down, it was easier to start drawing other shapes and adding color, or implement loops and conditionals. Once I figured out how to fix the problem in my code to get it running, I gained more confidence and felt more optimistic about solving future problems.</p>
